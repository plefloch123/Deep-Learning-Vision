## Introduction
We will explore various deep learning functionalities through implementing a number of pytorch neural network operations/layers and creating our own deep learning model and methodology for a high dimensional classification problem.

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a **Deep Learning project** focused on training and evaluating neural networks. The work involves:
- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Evaluation and performance analysis

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📂 Project Structure

```
Deep-Learning-Vision/
│-- dl_cw_1.ipynb        # Main project notebook
│-- README.md            # This file
│-- requirements.txt     # Dependencies
```

## 🔧 Dependencies

The following Python packages are required:

```python
import sys

assert sys.version_info >= (3, 10), f"Python 3.10 or higher is required for this coursework, but you are using {sys.version}. Please use a more recent Python version or you might face compatibility issues."
```

## 🏃 Usage
